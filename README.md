# OBJECT-RANGE-DETECTION-SENSOR-USING-ULTRASONIC-SENSOR-AND-ARDUINO-UNO
The objective of this project is to design and implement an Object Range Detection Sensor  system using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno, as the core controller. This system  aims to measure the distance of any object in front of it and alert users based on the  proximity using a set of LED indicators and a buzzer.
